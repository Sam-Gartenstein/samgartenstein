# Hi, I’m Sam 👋  

🎓 **Data Scientist | Quantitative Social Scientist**  

I am a recent graduate of Columbia University's Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences (QMSS) program, where I focused on applying advanced statistical modeling, machine learning, and data visualization to real-world problems. My work spans public policy, climate risk, sports analytics, and education technology, with a consistent focus on building data-driven solutions that are rigorous, interpretable, and impactful.

## 🔭 What I am Workoing On 

🌍 **[Zambia Index Insurance Optimization](https://github.com/Sam-Gartenstein/zambia-index-insurance-optimization)** — *Weather Index Insurance Risk Reduction*

Examines how different **zoning methods** impact **fairness** in **weather index insurance payouts**. Conducted in collaboration with **Columbia University’s International Research Institute for Climate and Society**, this project uses **rainfall data** across Zambia’s **provinces, districts, and camp-level zones**, as well as **K-means clusters**, to evaluate **forgone payouts** and quantify the **marginal benefit of increasing zone granularity**.

⚾ **[Home Run Prediction](https://github.com/Sam-Gartenstein/home-run-prediction)**  - *Hierarchical Bayesian model estimating the probability of MLB home runs*

**Bayesian hierarchical model** estimating the probability of a **home run** for each MLB plate appearance, incorporating **batter, pitcher, and ballpark effects**. The model leverages **partial pooling** to stabilize estimates across players and venues, enabling more accurate predictions even when matchup data is sparse.

## 🌱 Past Projects and Contributions

- **[Lights, Camera, ReAction](https://github.com/Sam-Gartenstein/Lights-Camera-ReAction)** - *Generative AI Application*

  Sitcom script generation pipeline powered by ReAct-based agents, where Character, Comedy, and Environment Agents collaborate like a virtual writers’ room to create scene-by-scene scripts. Each scene is dynamically generated, refined, and stored with metadata in a vector database, enabling coherent storytelling with consistent character arcs, running jokes, and continuity across episodes. 

- **[GradeMate](https://github.com/laurauguc/grading_assistant)** - *App Development*
  
  GradeMate is an open-source application designed to assist teachers with grading by providing AI-generated recommendations. I led the prompt engineering and multi-agent design, and we submitted the project to Google’s Gemini Developer Competition. Developed in collaboration with Columbia University's QMSS Innovation Lab, GradeMate is being expanded as a transparent, contestable, and ethically grounded alternative to commercial tools, promoting responsible innovation in educational technology in contrast to closed-source solutions that often make broad claims about eliminating bias or surpassing human performance.


- **[Zambia Rainfall Clustering Analysis](https://github.com/Sam-Gartenstein/zambia-drought-analysis)** - *Clustering Analysis*

  Built upon the initial analysis by clustering directly on Google Earth Engine rainfall pixel data to better capture granularity in rainfall patterns. Developed a metric for basis risk in weather index insurance and compared K-means–derived zones with traditional administrative boundaries.

- **[Drought Identification, Trend Analysis, and Clustering Across Zambia](https://github.com/Sam-Gartenstein/KenyaDroughtAnalysis)** - *Trend and Clustering Analysis*
  
  Initial analysis of rainfall in Zambia, examining and quantifying drought severity using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). Applied K-means and hierarchical clustering to group administrative zones based on rainfall patterns.
