# Hi, I’m Sam 👋  

🎓 **Data Scientist | Quantitative Social Scientist**  

I am a recent graduate of Columbia University's Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences (QMSS) program, where I focused on applying advanced statistical modeling, machine learning, and data visualization to real-world problems. My work spans public policy, climate risk, sports analytics, and education technology, with a consistent focus on building data-driven solutions that are rigorous, interpretable, and impactful.

**[Zambia Index Insurance Optimization](https://github.com/Sam-Gartenstein/zambia-index-insurance-optimization)** — *Weather Index Insurance Risk Reduction*

Examines how different zoning methods impact fairness in weather index insurance payouts. Conducted in collaboration with Columbia University’s International Research Institute for Climate and Society, this project uses rainfall data across Zambia’s provinces, districts, and camp-level zones, as well as K-means clusters, to evaluate forgone payouts and quantify the marginal benefit of increasing zone granularity.
