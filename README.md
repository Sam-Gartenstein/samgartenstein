# Hi, I’m Sam 👋  

🎓 **Data Scientist | Quantitative Social Scientist**  

I am a recent graduate of Columbia University's Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences (QMSS) program, where I focused on applying advanced statistical modeling, machine learning, and data visualization to real-world problems. My work spans public policy, climate risk, sports analytics, and education technology, with a consistent focus on building data-driven solutions that are rigorous, interpretable, and impactful.

## 🔭 What I am Workoing On 

🌍 **[Zambia Index Insurance Optimization](https://github.com/Sam-Gartenstein/zambia-index-insurance-optimization)** — *Weather Index Insurance Risk Reduction*

Examines how different **zoning methods** impact **fairness** in **weather index insurance payouts**. Conducted in collaboration with **Columbia University’s International Research Institute for Climate and Society**, this project uses **rainfall data** across Zambia’s **provinces, districts, and camp-level zones**, as well as **K-means clusters**, to evaluate **forgone payouts** and quantify the **marginal benefit of increasing zone granularity**.

⚾ **[Home Run Prediction](https://github.com/Sam-Gartenstein/home-run-prediction)**  - *Hierarchical Bayesian model estimating the probability of MLB home runs*

**Bayesian hierarchical model** estimating the probability of a **home run** for each MLB plate appearance, incorporating **batter, pitcher, and ballpark effects**. The model leverages **partial pooling** to stabilize estimates across players and venues, enabling more accurate predictions even when matchup data is sparse.
